# Server Repository

This repository holds our server files. 

## Getting Started for Developers

### Starting the server

How to run this server

In the project directory, you can run:

"__npm run server__" to run the server at PORT=5000

Look for "Connected to Server Port: ${PORT}" or "${error} Failed to connect" in the console.

(You will need to finish setting up your __.env__ file before starting the server.)


### Setting up the .env variables file

1. Create a __.env__ in your local server project repository

2. Create a __PORT=5000__ variable in the file. __PORT__ can also be connected to any port number but defaults to 5001 if the PORT variable fails.

3. Create a __MONGO_URI=__ variable where __MONGO_URI=__ is your personal MongoDB Atlas connection URI.
