### Branch Creation

When creating working branches for Jira issues/tickets, use the __development__ branch as the main branch you are pulling from.

We will merge our branches into the __development__ branch before merging into the __master__ branch to review code and avoid major issues.

## Getting Started for Developers

### Running the project

How to run this project/app

In the client directory, you can run:

"__npm run dev__" to run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Running the server

How to run the server

In the server directory, you can run:

"__npm run server__" to run the server.

### Installing Node Modules

Change directories from the project repository to __client__ and then run "__npm install__".

Do the same for the __server__ repository.

Follow steps in the __client__ and __server__ repositories to finish setting up your local repository.
